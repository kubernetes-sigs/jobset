## Jobset

A JobSet creates one or more Jobs. It allows you to create sets of jobs of different or identical templates, and control their lifecycle together.

## Running an Example JobSet

Here is an example JobSet. It runs a distributed PyTorch training workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: jobset.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: JobSet
metadata:
  name: pytorch
spec:
  replicatedJobs:
    - name: workers
      template:
        spec:
          parallelism: 4
          completions: 4
          backoffLimit: 0
          template:
           spec:
            containers:
            - name: pytorch
              image: gcr.io/k8s-staging-jobset/pytorch-resnet:latest
              ports:
              - containerPort: 3389
              env:
              - name: MASTER_ADDR
                value: "pytorch-workers-0-0.pytorch"
              - name: MASTER_PORT
                value: "3389"
              command:
              - bash
              - -xc
              - |
                torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --master_addr=$MASTER_ADDR --master_port=$MASTER_PORT resnet.py --backend=gloo
```

To list all the jobs that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get jobs --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch
```

The output is similar to 

```
NAME                COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
pytorch-workers-0   0/4           6m12s      6m12s
```

To list all the pods that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get pods --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch
```

The output is similar to 

```
NAME                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pytorch-workers-0-0-tcngx   1/1     Running   0          13m
pytorch-workers-0-1-sbhxs   1/1     Running   0          13m
pytorch-workers-0-2-5m6d6   1/1     Running   0          13m
pytorch-workers-0-3-mn8c8   1/1     Running   0          13m
```

## JobSet defaults for Jobs and Pods

- Job [`completionMode`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#completion-mode) is defaulted to `Indexed` 
- Pod [`restartPolicy`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/#pod-template) is defaulted to `OnFailure`


## JobSet labels

JobSet labels will have `jobset.x-k8s.io/` prefix. JobSet sets the following labels on both the jobs and pods:
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name`: `.metadata.name`
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/replicatedjob-name`: `.spec.replicatedJobs[*].name`
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/replicatedjob-replicas`: `.spec.replicatedJobs[*].replicas`
- `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/job-index`: ordinal index of a job within a `spec.replicatedJobs[*]`


## ReplicatedJob

The list `.spec.replicatedJobs` allows the user to define groups of Jobs of different templates.

Each entry of `.spec.replicatedJobs` defines a Job template in `spec.replicatedJobs[*].template`, 
and the number replicas that should be created in `spec.replicatedJobs[*].replicas`. When 
unset, it is defaulted to 1.

Each Job in each `spec.replicatedJobs` gets a different job-index in the range 0 to `.spec.replicatedJob[*].replicas-1`. 
The Job name will have the following format: `<jobSetName>-<replicatedJobName>-<jobIndex>`. 


### DNS hostnames for Pods

By default, JobSet configures DNS for Pods by creating a headless service with name `spec.network.subdomain` which defaults to `.metadata.name` if not set.   

To list the headless service that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get services --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch
```

The output is similar to 

```
NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
pytorch-workers   ClusterIP   None         <none>        <none>    25m
```

The hostname for pod will have the following format: `<jobSetName>-<spec.replicatedJob[*].name>-<spec.replicatedJob[*].replicas[*]>-<pod-index>`. 

The FQDN for pod will have the following format: `<jobSetName>-<spec.replicatedJob[*].name>-<spec.replicatedJob[*].replicas[*]>-<pod-index>.<subdomain>`. 

To list all the hostname for the pods that belong to a JobSet, you can use a command like this:

```shell
kubectl get pods -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,HOSTNAME:.spec.hostname,Subdomain:.spec.subdomain --selector=jobset.sigs.k8s.io/jobset-name=pytorch

```

The output is similar to 

```
Name                         HOSTNAME                 Subdomain
pytorch-workers-0-0-tcngx   pytorch-workers-0-0.      pytorch
pytorch-workers-0-1-sbhxs   pytorch-workers-0-1       pytorch
pytorch-workers-0-2-5m6d6   pytorch-workers-0-2       pytorch
pytorch-workers-0-3-mn8c8.  pytorch-workers-0-3       pytorch
```

### Exclusive Job to topology placement

The JobSet annotation `alpha.jobset.sigs.k8s.io/exclusive-topology` defines 1:1 job to topology placement. 
For example, consider the case where the nodes are assigned a rack label. To optimize for network
performance, we want to assign each job exclusively to one rack. This can be done as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: jobset.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: JobSet
metadata:
  name: pytorch
  annotations:
    alpha.jobset.sigs.k8s.io/exclusive-topology: rack
spec:
  replicatedJobs:
    - name: workers
      template:
        spec:
          ...
```

## JobSet termination

A JobSet is marked as successful when ALL the Jobs it created completes successfully. 

A JobSet failure is counted when ANY of its child Jobs fail. `spec.failurePolicy.maxRestarts` defines how many times  
to automatically restart the JobSet. A restart is done by recreating all child jobs.

A JobSet is terminally failed when the number of failures reaches `spec.failurePolicy.maxRestarts`

## Coordinator

A specific pod can be assigned as coordinator using `spec.coordinator`. If
defined, a `jobset.sigs.k8s.io/coordinator` annotation and label with the stable
network endpoint of the coordinator Pod will be added to all Jobs and Pods in
the JobSet. This label can be useful by other Pods. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: jobset.x-k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: JobSet
metadata:
  name: pytorch
spec:
  coordinator:
    replicatedJob: leader
    jobIndex: 0
    podIndex: 0
  replicatedJobs:
    - name: leader
      replicas: 1
      template:
        spec:
          parallelism: 1
          completions: 1
          ...
    - name: workers
      replicas: 1
      template:
        spec:
          parallelism: 8
          completions: 8
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: worker
                env:
                - name: LEADER_ADDRESS
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      fieldPath: "metadata.labels['jobset.sigs.k8s.io/coordinator']"
            ...
```

All Jobs and Pods in the JobSet will have a
`jobset.sigs.k8s.io/coordinator=pytorch-leader-0-0.pytorch` label and annotation.

WARNING: if using Kueue with JobSet, ensure Kueue version v0.8.3+ or v0.9.0+ is
installed. Prior versions are built using a JobSet api definition that does not
have the coordinator field:
