![Version: 0.8.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.8.1-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: application](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-application-informational?style=flat-square)

A Helm chart for deploying JobSet controller and webhook on Kubernetes.

**Homepage:** <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset>

## Introduction

This Helm chart installs the JobSet controller and webhook to your Kubernetes cluster. JobSet is a Kubernetes controller that manages groups of related Jobs as a single unit.

## Prerequisites

- Helm >= 3
- Kubernetes >= 1.27

## Usage

### Install from registry.k8s.io

You can obtain the helm chart from `registry.k8s.io`.

```shell
helm install oci://registry.k8s.io/jobset/charts/jobset --version v0.8.1
```

The version is necessary as there is not a latest tag in this repository.

### Install the chart

```shell
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] charts/jobset
```

For example, if you want to create a release with name `jobset` in the `jobset-system` namespace:

```shell
helm install jobset charts/jobset \
    --namespace jobset-system \
    --create-namespace
```

Note that by passing the `--create-namespace` flag to the `helm install` command, `helm` will create the release namespace if it does not exist.

See [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install) for command documentation.

### Upgrade the chart

```shell
helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] charts/jobset-system [flags]
```

See [helm upgrade](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade) for command documentation.

### Uninstall the chart

```shell
helm uninstall [RELEASE_NAME]
```

This removes all the Kubernetes resources associated with the chart and deletes the release, except for the `crds`, those will have to be removed manually.

See [helm uninstall](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_uninstall) for command documentation.
