Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}. The JobSet controller is now deployed in your cluster. To verify that the controller is running, you can run:
  kubectl get deployment -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ include "jobset.controller.deployment.name" . }}
To access the metrics endpoint:
  kubectl port-forward svc/{{ include "jobset.metrics.service.name" . }} 8443
