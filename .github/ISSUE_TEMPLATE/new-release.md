      and inserts the changelog into the tag description.
      To perform this step, you need [a PGP key registered on github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/checking-for-existing-gpg-keys).
- [ ] An OWNER pushes the tag with
      `git push $VERSION`

  - [ ] Write the changelog into the draft release.
  - [ ] Run `make artifacts IMAGE_REGISTRY=registry.k8s.io/jobset`
      to generate the artifacts and upload the files in the `artifacts` folder
      to the draft release.
- [ ] Submit a PR against [k8s.io](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io), 
      updating `k8s.gcr.io/images/k8s-staging-jobset/images.yaml` to

      to production: <!-- example https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/8453-->
- [ ] Wait for the PR to be merged and verify that the image `registry.k8s.io/jobset/jobset:$VERSION` is available.
- [ ] Wait for the PR to be merged and verify that the chart `registry.k8s.io/jobset/charts/jobset` is available.

- [ ] For a major or minor release, create an unannotated _devel_ tag in the
      `main` branch, on the first commit that gets merged after the release
       branch has been created (presumably the README update commit above), and, push the tag:
      `DEVEL=v0.$(($MAJ+1)).0-devel; git tag $DEVEL main && git push $DEVEL`
      This ensures that the devel builds on the `main` branch will have a meaningful version number.
- [ ] For a major or minor release, submit a PR against [test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra),
      updating `config/jobs/kubernetes-sigs/jobset` periodics to drop n - 1 release and add a periodic
